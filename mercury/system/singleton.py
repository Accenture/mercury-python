class Singleton:
    """
    This helper class wraps any Class into a singleton object.

    Enhanced from answer#81 of
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/42558/python-and-the-singleton-pattern

    Example:

    TO DECLARE A SINGLETON CLASS

    from mercury.system.system import Singleton

    @Singleton
    class SystemConfig(BaseConfig):

        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            print "got some parameters", *args
            print "got some keyword parameters", **kwargs
            #
            # call the parent constructor if needed
            #
            super(self.__class__, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            #

    TO "INSTANTIATE" A SINGLETON CLASS

    from sysconf.config import SystemConfig

    config = SystemConfig('hello world')
    another_config = SystemConfig('parameter to be ignored in 2nd instantiation')
    print "same instance of SystemConfig?", config = another_config

    """

    _instance = None

    def __init__(self, decorated):
        self._decorated = decorated

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        if self._instance is None: self._instance = self._decorated(*args, **kwargs)
        return self._instance
